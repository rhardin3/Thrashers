2. Commiting  
Commiting can be difficult but we will do our best to help you through this scary and sometimes painful process.
While working in the *developer* branch, go into your notepad document and type out a header, a string, or any 
changes you wish to make. When finished, save your notepad document and return to Git. Still in the developer
branch, type *git add filename.md*. This will take a **snapshot** of your most recent work. Next, type 
*git commit -m 'comment'*. This will save the changes. Finally, type out **git push origin develop**. This 
will push the changes you have made to the online database.  
Note: You may have to use *git pull origin develop* prior to pushing your file.  
Happy coding!
