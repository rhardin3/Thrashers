1.  Getting Started
In order to get started on Git, one needs to create an account on github.com and download Git Bash. Once Git Bash
is successfully installed on one's computer, a new repository needs to be created. In order to create a new repository
git init can be used.

2. Commiting  
Commiting can be difficult but we will do our best to help you through this scary and sometimes painful process.
While working in the *developer* branch, go into your notepad document and type out a header, a string, or any 
changes you wish to make. When finished, save your notepad document and return to Git. Still in the developer
branch, type *git add filename.md*. This will take a **snapshot** of your most recent work. Next, type 
*git commit -m 'comment'*. This will save the changes. Finally, type out **git push origin develop**. This 
will push the changes you have made to the online database.  
Note: You may have to use *git pull origin develop* prior to pushing your file.  
Happy coding!
